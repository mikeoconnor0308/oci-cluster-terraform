Terraform configuration for a compute cluster on Oracle Cloud
=============================================================

Uses `terraform-provider-oci <https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci>`_.

Rename ``terraform.tfvars.example`` to ``terraform.tfvars`` and fill it with your information.

After a ``terraform apply`` it will output the compute and management public IPs which can be used to SSH into the machine as ``opc``.
